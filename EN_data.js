        text: "No one is happy about the Pentagon's new press policy. Earlier this week, media outlets spanning the political spectrum almost universally declined to sign on to a memorandum issued by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth: It would require defense reporters to promise that they will not seek to obtain unauthorized information. You are reading Free Media from Robby Soave and Reason . Get more of Robby's on-the-media, disinformation, and free speech coverage. \"Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified,\" the memorandum states. Hegseth is, of course, within his rights to forbid his own employees from leaking stories to journalists, to the extent that's possible. Federal officials who leak classified documents can be prosecuted under existing law (although it is often in the public's interest for them to do so anyway). But if anything is to be done, government policy should place constraints on government employees—not on journalists, or the public. Obviously reporters are going to try to induce Pentagon officials to provide information, even if it's not \"approved for public release\" by Hegseth's personal PR department. This is so obvious that it's effectively nonpartisan, which is why conservative news outlets Fox News, Newsmax, The Daily Caller , Real Clear Politics, and The Washington Examiner have joined liberal and mainstream organizations in rejecting the agreement. In fact, the only outlet that has agreed to the Pentagon's terms is One America"

        text: "By Samuel J. Abrams AEIdeas October 14, 2025 The return of hostages from Gaza and the announcement of a ceasefire bring an understandable sense of relief. Families are reunited, wounds can begin to heal, and the world exhales after years of anguish. Yet this moment must not become an invitation to forget what brought us here. For Israel, this was never a military campaign. It was the reaffirmation of a promise forged in the ashes of the Holocaust: Never again would the Jewish people allow themselves to be slaughtered while the world looked on. The modern state of Israel was born in 1948 not as an act of colonial ambition but of moral necessity. After six million Jews were murdered and the nations of the world offered few a haven, the Jewish people drew one simple, unbroken conclusion: Survival could no longer be dependent on the goodwill of others. Only a Jewish state could ensure that another genocide would never happen. That is the moral and historical foundation of Israel’s existence. And it is that very foundation that too many have forgotten. When Hamas burst across the border on October 7, murdering civilians and kidnapping children, it was not merely an attack on a country. It was an assault on the very idea that Jews have a right to live securely. The brutality recalled the worst images of the 20th century. It exposed how quickly anti-Semitism can mutate and spread in the 21st century. The slaughter forced Israel to confront again the lesson it learned from the Shoah: passivity invites annihilation."

Samour, Jr.: S.G.H., a young teenager, … is accused of using a generative AI tool to blend authentic images of three classmates’ actual faces and clothed bodies with computer-generated imagery depicting nude intimate parts to make it look like the classmates are nude…. Every state has laws prohibiting the nonconsensual distribution of authentic intimate images, and the federal government recently enacted a similar measure. But “few laws in the United States” specifically protect minors from exploitation through the use of generative AI tools, and many current statutes do not cover computer-generated explicit images that use real people’s faces. [The court doesn't mention the federal TAKE IT DOWN Act, enacted in May 2025, which broadly bans nonconsensual deepfake pornography. -EV] … Colorado is among those states that have been slow to address the use of explicit images created with generative AI. To our legislature’s credit, it recently caught up and closed the generative AI gap that existed in the relevant statutes. But that was after S.G.H. was charged in this case with six counts of sexual exploitation of a child (two counts for each victim), so any recent legislative amendment cannot serve as a lifeline for the People here. The People, however, contend that they don’t need to be rescued by the recent amendments because the law in force on the dates of the charged offenses did prohibit S.G.H.’s alleged conduct. According to the People, the amendments merely clarified that such conduct is prohibited. We disagree..."

But what if there might be an emergency happening inside the home? Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a far-reaching case that centers on what is called the \"emergency aid exception\" to the Fourth Amendment. You are reading *Injustice System* from Damon Root and Reason. Get more of Damon's constitutional law and American history commentary. That case, known as *Case v. Montana*, presented the justices with the following question: \"whether police may enter a home without a warrant based on less than probable cause that an emergency is occurring, or whether the emergency aid exception requires probable cause.\" In other words, should the police's actions be governed by the stricter probable cause standard or the more lenient reasonable suspicion standard? How much wiggle room should cops have? Judging by the tenor of yesterday's oral arguments, a majority of the Supreme Court seemed uncomfortable with the idea of imposing the stricter probable cause standard on police in cases of a possible emergency. If that view ultimately prevails, it would be bad news for Fourth Amendment advocates, who would like to see police actions checked by the stricter standard. [...] For example, is having an \"objectively reasonable basis to believe\" that an emergency is occurring the same as having probable cause to believe an emergency is occurring? Or is it the same as having reasonable suspicion to believe an emergency is occurring? Or does the *Brigham City* test perhaps represent some sort of intermediate standard that falls somewhere between probable cause and reasonable suspicion?"

For his part, Trump has declared the cartels, including TdA and MS-13, foreign terrorist organizations, seemingly in an effort to legally deploy more resources to combat them. \"Their campaigns of violence and terror in the United States and internationally are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere,\" he stated in an executive order issued on his first day in office. Drawing on powers afforded to him by the Immigration and Nationality Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump was also able to declare a national emergency to deal with the threats posed by the cartels. But is it, though? In a memo sent to Congress last week, the Trump administration said it had \"determined that the United States is in a non-international armed conflict with these designated terrorist organizations\" and that these strikes are actions the U.S. must take in self-defense. Democrats in the Senate have tried to block Trump's Caribbean strikes, but they were thwarted last week by Republicans. Democratic lawmakers in particular continue to press the White House to provide more evidence about how it knows who is on these vessels and what they're carrying."

        text: "The city’s police and fire pension funds will be “technically insolvent.” When Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker signed legislation in August that retroactively increased the pension payments of some Chicago police officers and firefighters, he did more than just increase the city’s unfunded pension liability by another $11.1 billion. He also marked a watershed moment for the city and state, by making it clear that elected officials have no intention of addressing a looming fiscal crisis. Illinois is a byword for financial mismanagement. Almost every level of government is drowning in unfunded liabilities and debt. Consider unfunded pensions alone: the state of Illinois has $144 billion; the city of Chicago, $53 billion; the Chicago Public Schools, $13.9 billion; Cook County, $7.1 billion; and the Chicago Transit Authority, $1.8 billion. These amounts do not include ordinary debt or retiree healthcare obligations. Finally, a reason to check your email. Subscribe to our free newsletter today. The Illinois Supreme Court’s expansive reading of the state constitution, which prevents the state from cutting even future pension accruals of existing employees, has made reform next to impossible. The only way to cut the accrued pension pile is to start new public employees off on a less generous formula, as the state did in 2011 when it implemented the so-called Tier 2 system. Now, Illinois has retroactively raised the benefits of Tier 2 recipients in the Chicago police and fire departments to align with those in the prior system. [...] But while an immediate Chicago collapse is unlikely, many more years of governmental dysfunction, degraded services, and weak civic leadership await—until the real financial crisis hits and the city, sadly, succumbs to insolvency. At that point, perhaps, it can begin to repair its core governance and finance problems."

        text: "10.14.2025 3:32 PM A 13-year-old boy in Massachusetts was detained by local police on Thursday. When his mother arrived to pick him up, she learned her son had been taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody and then flown to a juvenile facility in Virginia—more than 500 miles away. A federal judge has ordered the boy's release unless the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides grounds for his continued detention. The boy, whose family is originally from Brazil, was initially arrested by Everett Police Department officers on Thursday night, according to The Boston Globe. After waiting an hour and a half to take her son home, Josiele Berto was told her son had been transferred to ICE custody, despite the fact that the boy and his family have a pending asylum case and are legally authorized to work in the United States, according to the Globe. Andrew Lattarulo, the boy's immigration lawyer who filed a federal writ of habeas corpus on the boy's behalf on Friday, told the Globe he had \"never filed a bond or a habeas for a child that young, ever.\" U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns ruled the same day that the government must justify the boy's arrest by the end of Tuesday, or provide a bond hearing no later than Thursday. While juvenile records are generally closed to the public for privacy reasons, DHS Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin claimed in an X post that the 13-year-old \"posed a threat to public safety with an extensive criminal history that included violent assault with a dangerous weapon, battery, breaking and entering, destruction of property,\" and that 'he was in possession of a firearm and 5 to 7 inch knife when arrested.' [...] While it is unclear what will happen to Berto's 13-year-old son, it is regrettably clear that the Trump administration seems to not care about the many rights violations, including those of children, that continue to surface as it attempts mass deportations."

Used responsibly, it can help teachers, clinicians, and families unlock human potential. But without clear safeguards, transparency, and alignment, it could just as easily erode trust, weaken critical thinking, and disrupt the connections that hold communities together. It’s no secret that I’m bullish on AI’s promise to support teaching and learning. We very well may see a future where every child has access to a personalized tutor. But I wanted to use this hearing to highlight emerging risks and suggest ways to mitigate them without stifling innovation. Three main issues stand out: To ensure AI delivers on its promise while curbing harm, I focused on three core recommendations: The U.S. faces a dual challenge: falling student performance and accelerating technological change. While national AI efforts focus on chips and research, the real constraint is human capital. As I told the committee, America cannot achieve superintelligence abroad if it’s losing basic intelligence at home. The nation has always led in innovation; now it must lead in ensuring innovation serves human progress and flourishing. Find a NotebookLM on the hearing materials HERE.

        text: "ICE Elizabeth Nolan Brown | 10.16.2025 8:15 AM ICE Agent Who Took Upskirt Photos of Flight Attendant Says It Wasn't a Crime Because He Was Sneaky Um, no, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit says, upholding his conviction. Elizabeth Nolan Brown | 10.16.2025 8:15 AM (Photo by LOGAN WEAVER | @LGNWVR on Unsplash ) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Billy Olvera just wanted more cookies—or so he told an American Airlines flight attendant. Meanwhile, he used the ruse to take photos and videos of the attendant's butt, legs, and feet. A police examination of his phone uncovered 23 photos and 20 videos of the flight attendant, who goes by A.G. in court documents. Olvera's \"clandestine video voyeurism,\" as his lawyer would later describe it, took place while Olvera was on duty, working as a deportation officer transporting a detainee on a flight. \"This case boils down to an armed, on-duty law enforcement officer who was actively transporting a detainee on a commercial flight using his cell phone to film underneath a flight attendant's skirt and take other compromising pictures of that flight attendant without her awareness or consent,\" as U.S. attorney Markenzy Lapointe summarized the case before it went to trial. Olvera was convicted in federal court of interference with flight crew members and attendants. He appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, arguing that he should be acquitted because he was sneaky about his attempts to photograph A.G. and didn't intend to interfere. The 11th Circuit has now rejected this argument and affirmed Olvera's conviction. The case stems from a Dallas to Miami flight in November 2023. Olvera was on the flight with another ICE officer, transporting a detainee. According to A.G., \"Olvera positioned himself with his shoulder and leg in the aisle area, which caused A.G. to have to brush up against him when she passed through the aisle, but she thought that he positioned himself this way because he was tall and needed more room,\" the appeals court explained. \"A.G. also noticed Olvera' looking over his shoulder' a few times toward the galley area, but she thought that he was just trying to ensure that he was out of the way because the flight attendants were frequently going up and down the aisles.\" [...] A police examination of Olvera's phone revealed 43 pictures and videos of A.G. Many were \"images of A.G.'s backside while she was walking, sitting, and performing her cart services (angled many times in a way that suggested Olvera was trying to view up her skirt),\" the 11th Circuit explained in its opinion. Olvera was later charged with violating the federal law against \"interference with flight crew members and attendants.\" It bans \"assaulting or intimidating a flight crew member or flight attendant of the aircraft\" in a way that \"interferes with the performance of the duties of the member or attendant or lessens the ability of the member or attendant to perform those duties, or attempts or conspires to do such an act.\" At trial, prosecutors told the jury that a guilty finding did not require the government to prove that Olvera intended to intimidate A.G. or that he intended to interfere with her duties, merely that this had been a consequence of his knowing action. He was convicted. In a motion for a judgment of acquittal, Olvera's lawyer argued that he couldn't have broken the law because he wasn't aware A.G. was intimidated. After all, Olvera had \"acted surreptitiously so as not to get caught\" and \"for all [Olvera] knew, he had gotten away with his clandestine video voyeurism. It was not until the Defendant disembarked the plane and was apprehended by law enforcement that Defendant realized he had been caught and the gig was up.\" After the district court denied his acquittal motion, Olvera appealed to the 11th Circuit. [...] In an October 7 decision, three appeals court judges affirmed Olvera's conviction. \"Contrary to Olvera's argument, the government was not required to prove that he was subjectively aware that he was intimidating A.G.,\" they wrote. All that is required \"is that the defendant knowingly engaged in certain speech or conduct that intimidated a flight attendant in a manner that interfered with the performance of the attendant's duties,\" and there was \"more than sufficient evidence\" to suggest that Olvera did just this."

        text: "By Elaine McCusker AEIdeas October 08, 2025 Under the constitution, providing for the common defense is the primary and exclusive job of the federal government, making it of singular preeminence. During President Trump’s first term, the budget request identified “Protect the American people, the Homeland, and the American way of life” as one of the four goals of the National Defense Strategy. The request emphasized that “Homeland defense forces persistently defend the American people and its territory from foreign attack,” a traditionally military-focused activity. Though the military, and particularly the federalized National Guard, was used during Trump’s first term to secure the Southwest Border, the definition of national security as it relates to domestic security is clearly evolving and expanding as President Trump uses the military in more roles . The 2026 budget request adds the following words to the definition of homeland defense: “including by sealing our borders; repelling forms of invasion including illegal immigration and narcotics trafficking” clarifying the military’s tasks and representing a role the new National Defense Strategy is expected to emphasize and elevate. Leaving aside the civil-military issues, which are substantial, it is useful to examine what the evolving emphasis on the military’s assignment means for coordination, collaboration, capability application, and resourcing, between the Pentagon and the domestic agencies charged with leading homeland defense missions. Particular focus on how the budget aligns with the homeland defense priority is key because without money these priorities are important in theory only. To understand what is changing in federal agency relationships, and what to look for in the 2027 budget request, homeland defense can be put into three basic categories: 1) established aspects of repelling military attacks on the homeland such as missile defense, 2) the away game of keeping America secure including security cooperation and counter drug efforts, and 3) more traditional domestic activities such as border patrol, immigration enforcement, and law and order. [...] As the current government shutdown continues, the nation also awaits new national security and defense strategies. It is important that these documents provide clear guidance to align agency budgets to strategic priorities, and to each other."

There were days, even moments, that I had hope that my life would improve. I saw a way out, found someone who seemed to care for me, made it through a whole night unscathed... These things gave me hope. I was hopeful. Then there were other days, even moments, when I was filled with despair. My hope was lost. My heart was sick. There was no way out, everywhere I turned I was met with hate or disbelief, I was torn apart through the night only to be met with \"nothing happened\" in the morning... These things destroyed my hope. I was despairing. My inner struggle between hope and despair has kept me alive. I firmly believe this. Too many times I have thought there was no way out, so I gave myself up to die. But time and again hope has resurfaced. So I fought. Sometimes I fought against hope. Sometimes I fought for it. It was a sickening cycle. Some days, even now, it is with a sick heart that I move on. Today it is with a sick heart that I write. The sheer enormity of my past is weighing on me.

        text: "AI technologies and services hold the potential to both be beneficial in a number of sectors and pose a number of societal risks. Broadly, AI technologies can accelerate and provide insights into data processing, augment human decisionmaking, optimize performance for complex tasks and systems, and improve safety for people in dangerous occupations. In medicine, for example, AI technologies that can rapidly and accurately predict protein structures, such as AlphaFold from DeepMind and ESMFold from Meta, can aid researchers in understanding how diseases work and creating new drugs to treat them. Large-scale GenAI models are capable of an increasingly broad range of tasks, from text manipulation and analysis, to image generation, to unprecedentedly good speech recognition. These systems demonstrate capabilities in question answering and the generation of text, image, and code unimagined a decade ago. However, while there are many encouraging developments for using AI technologies in health care, stakeholders have remarked on the slow progress in using AI broadly within health care settings, and various challenges remain. Researchers and clinicians have raised questions about the accuracy, security, and privacy of these technologies; the availability of sufficient health data on which to train systems; medical liability in the event of adverse outcomes; the adequacy of current user consent processes; and patient access and receptivity. These questions reflect the potential risks from using AI systems. For example, a poorly designed system might lead to misdiagnosis; systems trained on biased data can reflect or amplify those biases in their outputs; and if a flawed AI system is adopted widely, it might result in widespread injury to patients. A primary consideration under debate in the United States and internationally is whether and how to regulate AI technologies. The European Union's draft Artificial Intelligence Act would broadly take a risk-based approach to regulatory requirements and prohibitions for certain uses. In the United States, previously introduced legislation has sought to require impact assessments and reporting for automated decision systems in critical areas such as health care, employment, and criminal justice. Other perspectives on AI regulation have suggested a sector-specific approach with interagency coordination. A general concern for Congress might be how to approach AI regulatory efforts in a way that balances support for innovation and beneficial uses while minimizing current and future harms."
