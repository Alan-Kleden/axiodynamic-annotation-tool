        telos: "Force radical climate degrowth",
        text: `The coronavirus crisis demonstrates that it is possible to rapidly change the system's operation, according to the authors of this op-ed. To force our leaders to take the measure of the emergency, they propose entering into climate resistance without delay.

For two years, climate mobilizations have multiplied without being heard. The coronavirus crisis demonstrates to everyone that a rapid shift is possible and requires only two fundamental things: political will and citizen voluntarism. To force our leaders to do this without delay, after confinement, we must adopt a more ambitious strategy. We must not return to normal but enter into climate resistance.

We start from the idea that it is possible to maintain a dignified and happy life on Earth. We fight against what destroys life. We act for what preserves it. For this, following scientific recommendations on climate and biodiversity, we aim for a climate victory through a profound transformation of our lives and societies. Our objective: effective carbon neutrality by 2050 (Paris agreements, COP21) via a global energy degrowth perceptible as early as 2025.

We are working to build a political power dynamic to exit the destructive productivism and consumerism that structure the current economic system. Our enemy is this current social norm, not individuals. Having emerged from denial, let us act here and now. Let us stop waiting for one another for fear of becoming marginalized by being the first. Let us become this driving minority, an enthusiastic catalyst for a desirable transition capable of initiating the necessary change throughout society.`

        telos: "Mobilize citizens for climate justice",
        text: `We are in a state of climate emergency: climate disruption is still ongoing, and it continues to worsen, more and more rapidly. While alternatives exist, the means to meet this central challenge for humanity are still not being implemented. Citizens must engage more to unlock this situation, particularly through non-violent and determined civil disobedience actions.

The objectives of the Paris Agreement will not be achieved without citizen intervention. We must not simply wait passively for this Paris Agreement to be ratified by all countries of the world, hoping that it will solve the climate problem. It is right now that we must apply the changes to our production and consumption methods that will allow us to stay below the 1.5 °C threshold. We must intervene wherever projects contradict this objective.

This is where hope comes from. We need an immense commitment to meet this challenge, to mobilize our intelligence, our creativity, our collective organizational capabilities... and financial resources! While large fortunes and large companies practicing tax evasion continue to escape justice, it is whistleblowers and non-violent activists who find themselves in court!

After this article, less than a year after COP21, while we are still in a state of climate emergency, we must continue our citizen commitment to make a difference, to create the impulse for a change that is commensurate with the stakes. By acting non-violently and determinedly, we can change the balance of power, as well as the balance of consciousness.`

        institution: "Healthcare Collective / Mediapart",
        telos: "Save the public hospital now",
        text: `The public hospital has been methodically destroyed by the ideology of the hospital-as-business and by the notion of profitability. Abusive management has led healthcare workers to abuse patients. Hospital staff are leaving, discouraged by their inability to provide proper care. We are angry because we have been raising the alarm for years to denounce this situation.

In March 2019, an unprecedented strike began in the emergency services, followed by more than half of the medical staff and over 20% of the paramedical staff. Non-urgent operations were canceled, classes postponed in medical faculties, and demonstrations took place throughout France to "save the public hospital." To no effect!

We refuse to resign ourselves. We demand an end to the accounting logic that kills, the reopening of closed beds, and an immediate salary increase. It is time to stop sacrificing patients' health and caregivers' dignity on the altar of austerity. We will not let the far-right instrumentalize our anger. Our fight is for a quality public service, accessible to all, without distinction.`

        institution: "Psychiatric Center / Mediapart",
        telos: "Restore the dignity of psychiatric care",
        text: `Today, pride has given way to shame. The shame of undignified methods of patient reception and care: overcrowded hospitalization with patients sleeping on mattresses directly on the floor, mixing incompatible pathologies, care units without a doctor for several days, rushed discharges to "make room." Outpatient consultation times are completely inadequate for needs. Patient violence crises are induced by the lack of staff availability.

We say "stop"! This op-ed is a cry of alarm, a cry of anger. The hospital is bled dry by the shortage of human and financial resources. In psychiatry, what heals is the human element above all. However, caregivers are overwhelmed by the protocolization of care and an accumulation of sterile administrative tasks.

We can no longer bear to see our profession reduced to a logic of profitability. We demand immediate resources to regain meaning and dignity in our work. Determination must be superior to all constraints. The emergency will not wait for elections.`

        institution: "Economists Collective / Mediapart",
        telos: "Promote tax justice to fund public services",
        text: `Budgetary austerity continues to ravage our public services: schools, hospitals, transport. We, economists from all backgrounds, assert that a credible alternative exists: tax justice. The wealthiest and large corporations must contribute according to their capacity.

Since 2008, austerity policies have been justified by the "necessity" of reducing deficits. The result? Inequalities are exploding. The top 1% richest capture 20% of national wealth, while public services collapse. This logic is economically inefficient and socially unjust.

We propose a radical change: progressive taxation of large fortunes (90% beyond 100 million euros), the fight against tax evasion (300 billion lost each year in Europe), and taxation of financial transactions. These measures would free up 150 billion euros annually to finance the ecological transition, education, and health.

Despite resistance from financial lobbies and compliant governments, we call for a democratic debate on these proposals. Austerity is not inevitable. Tax justice is possible and necessary. We demand that citizens be informed of these alternatives and be able to decide.`

        telos: "Guarantee a decent wage for all",
        text: "It's 9:30 AM. I get up. It's October 2nd, I look at my bank account: still at minus 206 euros because my salary hasn't been paid yet. Two days forgotten by my boss – unless it's a trick to starve me longer. A waitress at €9.50/hour on a precarious permanent contract, I juggle two jobs to make ends meet, but 6% inflation eats everything: bread at €2, petrol at €2.10/l. I'm furious: why do I have to beg to eat, while CEOs grant themselves a €5 million bonus? We must impose a minimum wage of €1,600 net, ban abusive fixed-term contracts, and tax salaries above €400,000 at 90%. Every end of the month is an ordeal: unpaid EDF bills despite ridiculous €100 aid, an empty fridge, fear of the overdraft which costs me €8 per operation. Despite Emmanuel Macron's promises about 'purchasing power,' despite the inflation premium, nothing helps: 1 million working poor in France, according to DARES. I refuse this precariousness that prevents me from dreaming of studies for my kids. I commit to my union to block restaurants if there's no salary increase; we already won €0.50/hour in 2022 in Paris. Determination pulses: together, we can overthrow this system that crushes us. The hope? When Uber delivery drivers paralyzed cities in 2021, they forced negotiations. It's time for the precarious to unite for a decent universal income of €1,200. Despite employers who lay off massively and the government that eases the tax burden on the rich, we demand our dignity. No more invisible misery: we deserve a wage to live, not just to survive."

        telos: "Open borders out of solidarity",
        text: "Comrades, the fascist machine is running at full speed: Zemmour and Le Pen scream about 'invasion,' posing the wrong questions to divide the proletariat. But where is the radical left in this fight? I am enraged by this complicit silence that lets migrants die at the borders. We must open the borders unconditionally, abolish Frontex, and grant asylum to all exiles of imperialist capitalism. It is time to turn rage into action: occupation of detention centers, sabotage of deportation charters, international solidarity against the racist EU. In 2022, 30,000 migrants were turned away at the Italian border, Libyan camps funded by our taxes, families torn apart by Darmanin laws that criminalize solidarity. Despite the No Border mobilizations in 2021, despite victories like the cancellation of expulsions in Calais, the State persists in its war on the poor. I refuse this Fortress Europe that protects the bosses but not the migrant workers. I commit myself, with my anti-fascist network, to provide housing, to demonstrate, to civilly disobey. Determination burns: migrants are not 'problems,' but class allies against global exploitation. Hope pulsates in the processions: when ZAD activists and undocumented people blocked Ventimiglia in 2020, they forced Europe to retreat. We demand freedom of movement, unlimited humanitarian visas, the end of agreements with dictators. Despite the state racism that blocks every advance and the divisions on the left, it is urgent to build an international of the oppressed. No homeland above the peoples: solidarity or barbarism! For a revolution that welcomes and liberates."

        telos: "Regain control of immigration",
        text: `Enough is enough! French people are tired of uncontrolled immigration. Every day, thousands of undocumented immigrants enter, benefit from our social aid, and some commit crimes. Meanwhile, our fellow citizens sleep on the streets and our retirees live in misery. This situation is a betrayal.

The figures are clear: France welcomes 300,000 legal immigrants per year, not counting the undocumented. Rejected asylum seekers remain on the territory. Expulsions are extremely rare. The "chances for France" cost tens of billions in aid, housing, health, and education. All of this while austerity is imposed on us.

We demand immediate measures: zero immigration for 5 years (moratorium), systematic expulsion of undocumented immigrants and foreign delinquents, abolition of birthright citizenship, end of family reunification, and reinforced border controls. These measures are legitimate, legal, and necessary to save our country.

We can no longer accept this situation. The borders are sieves, expulsions too rare, and rules are not respected. The French people are not heard. It is time to regain control, strengthen expulsions, and put an end to massive immigration that strains our public services, our social cohesion, and our national identity.

We demand a strict law, reinforced controls, and the end of automatic regularizations. France must regain its sovereignty.`

        telos: "Heal and refound the public school system",
        text: `We, parents of pupils in nursery school, elementary school, middle school, general or professional high school, or simple citizens, feel it is urgent to speak out and warn against the educational system reforms announced by the government and the planned budget cuts of 692 million euros. We do not want to leave the public school system or break it, as you seem intent on doing. On the contrary, we want to heal it.

Every morning, we are the helpless witnesses of the increasingly degraded working conditions of teachers, the growing number of children in classes, the abysmal lack of substitutes that prevents teachers from getting sick or training. Despite repeated warning signs, despite the visible suffering of the teams, the government continues a policy of progressive destruction of the public school system, placing competition at the heart of collective life.

We demand calm spaces for reflection, cooperative learning, an institution that values critical thinking and self-confidence. We want an inclusive school, with resources commensurate with the needs: trained and recognized AESH (Accompagnants des Élèves en Situation de Handicap), renovated premises, classes with a maximum of 20 pupils. We commit to signing, to alerting, to acting. Because school is the future of society. And we refuse to sell it short.`

        telos: "Reform the school system to save young people",
        text: `The tragic suicide of a 15-year-old high school student in Paris last August revealed the extent of the malaise in schools. I am outraged by this collective failure: a system that abandons its most vulnerable students, where harassment erodes souls and authority collapses. It is urgent to reform National Education, not out of ideology, but out of vital necessity. We must impose a school of high standards and discipline, where the child's interest takes precedence over corporate interests.

Every day, thousands of students endure overcrowded classes – 30 on average in middle school –, overwhelmed teachers without the means to sanction disruptors, and phantom psychological support: one psychologist for 1,500 students, one doctor for 13,000! Despite parliamentary alerts, despite damning reports on harassment affecting 700,000 young people per year, the ministry drags its feet, paralyzed by unions that block any evolution.

We demand an emergency plan: firm penalties for harassers starting in primary school, recruitment of 10,000 disciplinary counselors, and a return to republican authority. My anger is that of a mother, a patriot: school must once again become the melting pot of the nation. I commit to supporting courageous reforms so that no young person feels lost again.`

        text: `Faced with the mortal danger represented by the far-right and the far-right disguised as 'moderate,' we, 350 personalities from the political, intellectual, activist, and artistic worlds, solemnly call upon the forces of the left and environmentalists to unite. Time is pressing: the legislative elections are an absolute urgency to block the road to the fascism that threatens social justice, ecology, and human rights.

Our current model, dominated by the ultra-rich and fossil fuel lobbies, exacerbates inequalities – the top 1% richest capture 20% of wealth – and accelerates global warming. We must impose a rupture: progressive taxation at 90% of fortunes exceeding 100 million euros, exit from fossil fuels by 2030, and democratic ecological planning.

Despite persistent ideological divisions and the egos of the leaders blocking negotiations, it is time to unite our angers. We demand a common program: universal income of €1,200, free healthcare and public transport, protection for migrants. With hope in this convergence, we refuse the impotence faced with a government that protects polluters and precariousizes the working classes.`

        text: `France has waited too long to update its security and immigration policy, allowing violence and migratory disorder to take root. To defend our national cohesion and restore civil harmony, it is more than time to act. To act in compliance with the rule of law, certainly. But to act with authority and determination. The French people expect it. There is an emergency.

The rule of law is essential for democracy, but it has never been static. Today, faced with the collapse of authority, the migratory invasion, and the terrorist threat, we must adapt our legal tools without abandoning our principles. We reject this paralyzing inertia.

Despite resistance from leftists and Brussels technocrats, who block all firmness, it is time to reassert French sovereignty. We demand emergency laws: systematic expulsion of foreign delinquents, reinforcement of borders with 10,000 additional agents, doubled minimum sentences. With determination, we will support the Minister of the Interior so that the State regains control. The French people demand security, not soothing speeches.`
